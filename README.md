# Original Readme:

# Long Reach

This is a very simple mod. It just sets the reach distance to a very large
value.

## Status

I am not maintaining this mod any more. If someone wants to fork and maintain
the mod, I'm happy to update this readme page to point to such a fork.
Please make a few commits first so I can know that you're serious, though.
;)

## Rationale

Do you ever find it annoying that you're not quite close enough to something to
place it? Are you playing marathon mode and constantly running around your base
refilling chests in the early game? Would you prefer Factorio to play more like
an RTS? This mod is for you.

If this mod is active, you can reach basically anything you can see in the
viewport. In fact, you can reach much further than that, but since you can't
scroll that far, you won't.

## Settings

You can change the reach distances in the mod settings page. By default, you
can reach just about the maximally zoomed out viewport. You can change it to allow
reaching much further (e.g. edit remote bases in zoomed-in map view).

## Caveats

Why `data-final-fixes.lua`? I don't know. data.lua didn't work. Maybe some other
mod was overriding the player prototype. This mod tries to take precedence
over all other mods that affect the reach distance. If you don't want that, this
mod is not for you.
